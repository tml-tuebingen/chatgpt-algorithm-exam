Sure, I'm ready to help you with your algorithm questions. Please go ahead and ask your questions. I'll do my best to provide short and precise answers.

Which of the following statements implies that $f(n) \in \Omega(g(n))$ holds? Exactly one statement is true. Please answer with a single letter a, b, c, or d.

a) $\square$ $f(n) \leq 4g(n)$ for all $n \geq 1$

b) $\square$ $f(n) \geq 4g(n)$ for all $n \geq 136$

c) $\square$ $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}=0$

d) $\square$ None of the above statements.
--------------------------
The correct answer is (a), which implies that $f(n) \in \Omega(g(n))$ holds.

Explanation:

The big-Omega notation $\Omega(g(n))$ represents a lower bound on the growth rate of a function. In other words, if $f(n) \in \Omega(g(n))$, it means that $g(n)$ grows no faster than $f(n)$ up to a constant factor. Mathematically, we can write this as:

0

0≤c⋅g(n)≤f(n)for all n≥n

	​

,

where $c$ and $n_0$ are constants.

Option (a) states that $f(n) \leq 4g(n)$ for all $n\geq 1$. This means that $g(n)$ is a lower bound on the growth rate of $f(n)$ up to a constant factor of 4. Therefore, we can say that $f(n) \in \Omega(g(n))$.

Option (b) states that $f(n) \geq 4g(n)$ for all $n\geq 136$. This does not necessarily imply that $g(n)$ is a lower bound on the growth rate of $f(n)$.

Option (c) states that the limit of $\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}$ as $n$ approaches infinity is 0. This implies that $g(n)$ grows faster than $f(n)$, which is the opposite of what is required for $f(n) \in \Omega(g(n))$.

Option (d) is incorrect because option (a) is true.
--------------------------
Now, again please answer "a", "b", "c" or "d" in order to indicate what is the correct answer.

Apologies for the mistake earlier. The correct answer is (a).
