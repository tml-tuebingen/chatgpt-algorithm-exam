Hello ChatGPT, I would like to ask you some questions from a computer science exam about algorithms. Are you ready for the questions? Please read the questions carefully and provide short, precise answers.

Sure, I'm ready. Please go ahead and ask your questions.

Consider hashing with linear probing and the hash function $h(x) = (7 \cdot x + 2) \mod 11.$ The corresponding hash table consists of an array of length 11. Insert the elements $2$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and $1$ in this order into the hash table.
--------------------------
Sure, here are the answers:

After inserting $2$, the hash table looks as follows:
css
Copy code
[ , ,2, , , , , , , , ]

After inserting $3$, the hash table looks as follows:
css
Copy code
[ , ,2,3, , , , , , , ]

After inserting $7$, the hash table looks as follows:
css
Copy code
[ ,7,2,3, , , , , , , ]

After inserting $15$, the hash table looks as follows:
csharp
Copy code
[15,7,2,3, , , , , , , ]


Note that $15$ hashes to the same index as $2$, so it must be placed in the next available slot in the table using linear probing.

After inserting $1$, the hash table looks as follows:
csharp
Copy code
[15,7,2,3,1, , , , , , ]


Note that $1$ hashes to index $1$, which is already occupied by $7$. Thus, we use linear probing to find the next available slot, which is index $4$.
