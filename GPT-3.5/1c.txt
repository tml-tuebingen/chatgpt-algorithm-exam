Prove that $\sqrt{n}\in o(n^{2/3})$ holds. Please be short and precise.
--------------------------
To prove that $\sqrt{n}\in o(n^{2/3})$, we need to show that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\sqrt{n}}{n^{2/3}} = 0$.

We can simplify the expression as follows:
$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\sqrt{n}}{n^{2/3}} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n^{1/2}}{n^{2/3}} = \lim_{n\to\infty}n^{-1/6} = 0$

Since the limit evaluates to 0, we have proven that $\sqrt{n}\in o(n^{2/3})$.
