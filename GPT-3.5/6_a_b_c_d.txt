Consider the following directed Graph.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=triangle 45,thick,node distance=25mm,scale=0.9,transform shape]
    \tikzstyle{every node}=[draw,shape=circle,minimum height=5mm,font=\small]
    
    \node (A) {A};
    \node (B) [above right of=A] {B};
    \node (C) [below right of=A] {C};
    \node (D) [right of=B] {D};
    \node (E) [right of=C] {E};
    \node (F) [right of=D] {F};
    \node (G) [right of=E] {G};
    \node (H) [right of=F] {H};
    \node (I) [right of=G] {I};
    \node (K) [right of=H] {K};
    \node (J) [right of=I] {J};
    
    \path[every node/.style={auto,outer sep=-2pt,font=\small}]
      (A) edge node{} (B)
      (A) edge node{} (C)
      (C) edge node{} (E)
      (C) edge node{} (B)
      (D) edge node{} (E)
      (E) edge node{} (C)
      (F) edge node{} (D)
      (E) edge node{} (G)
      (G) edge node{} (I)
      (I) edge node{} (H)
      (H) edge node{} (G)
      (G) edge node{} (F)
      (K) edge node{} (J)
      (H) edge node{} (J)
      (D) edge node{} (C);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

How many strongly connected components does this graph have?
--------------------------
To determine the strongly connected components (SCCs) of a directed graph, we can use the Kosaraju's algorithm, which consists of two depth-first searches. Alternatively, we can use the Tarjan's algorithm, which uses a single depth-first search and a stack.

Applying either of these algorithms to the given graph, we find that it has 4 strongly connected components:

{A}
{B, C, D, E}
{F, G, H, I}
{J, K}
--------------------------
Draw the corresponding component graph.
--------------------------
The component graph of a directed graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the original graph as nodes, and the edges between them as edges in the DAG. To obtain the component graph, we first contract each SCC of the original graph into a single node, and then add edges between the contracted nodes as follows:

For each edge (u, v) in the original graph, where u and v belong to different SCCs, add an edge from the node representing the SCC containing u to the node representing the SCC containing v.

The component graph for the given graph is as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=triangle 45,thick,node distance=25mm,scale=0.9,transform shape]
\tikzstyle{every node}=[draw,shape=circle,minimum height=5mm,font=\small]

\node (A) {A};
\node (BCDE) [right of=A] {B,C,D,E};
\node (FGHI) [below of=BCDE] {F,G,H,I};
\node (JK) [below of=A] {J,K};

\path[every node/.style={auto,outer sep=-2pt,font=\small}]
  (A) edge node{} (BCDE)
  (BCDE) edge[bend right=20] node{} (FGHI)
  (FGHI) edge[bend right=20] node{} (BCDE)
  (FGHI) edge[bend right=20] node{} (JK)
  (JK) edge[bend right=20] node{} (FGHI)
  (BCDE) edge[bend right=20] node{} (JK)
  (JK) edge[bend right=20] node{} (BCDE);


\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

In this component graph, there is an edge from node B,C,D,E to node F,G,H,I because there is a path from any node in B,C,D,E to any node in F,G,H,I in the original graph, and there is no edge from node F,G,H,I to node B,C,D,E because there is no path from any node in F,G,H,I to any node in B,C,D,E in the original graph. Similarly, there are edges from the node J,K to both the node B,C,D,E and the node F,G,H,I because there are paths from J,K to both of those SCCs in the original graph, and there are no edges from B,C,D,E or F,G,H,I to J,K because there are no paths from those SCCs to J,K in the original graph.
--------------------------
Number the different nodes of the component graph according to the alphabet, i.e., $A$, $B$, $C$, etc. Then specify a topological sort of the component graph.
--------------------------
To perform a topological sort on the component graph, we need to visit each node in a way that respects the order of the edges. Specifically, for each edge from node $u$ to node $v$, node $u$ should appear before node $v$ in the sorted list. Since the component graph is a DAG, a topological sort is always possible.

To perform a topological sort on the given component graph, we can use depth-first search with a post-order traversal, which will produce a list of nodes in the reverse topological order. In other words, the last node visited by the traversal will be the first node in the sorted list, and so on.

A topological sort of the given component graph is:

$A$, $J,K$, $F,G,H,I$, $B,C,D,E$

Note that this order satisfies the requirement that if there is an edge from node $u$ to node $v$, then node $u$ appears before node $v$ in the sorted list. Moreover, this order is unique, since each node has a unique post-order number in the traversal.
--------------------------
 Which nodes of the component graph are source nodes, which are sink nodes?
--------------------------
In the context of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a source node is a node with no incoming edges, while a sink node is a node with no outgoing edges.

In the component graph of the given graph, the node $A$ is a source node, because there are no edges leading into it. The nodes $B,C,D,E$ and $F,G,H,I$ are neither source nor sink nodes, because they have both incoming and outgoing edges. Finally, the nodes $J,K$ are sink nodes, because there are no edges leading out of them.

Therefore, in the component graph, the source node is $A$, and the sink nodes are $J,K$.
