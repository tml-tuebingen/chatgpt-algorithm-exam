If we could find the pivot element in the QuickSort algorithm in $O(1)$ time, then we would get the best guarantee on the running time with the arithmetic meanor the the median?
--------------------------
If we could find the pivot element in the QuickSort algorithm in $O(1)$ time, then we would get the best guarantee on the running time with the median pivot selection. The arithmetic mean pivot selection is not guaranteed to give the best performance, even if the pivot can be found in constant time.

In QuickSort, the choice of the pivot element has a significant impact on the running time of the algorithm. If a good pivot is chosen, then the algorithm will run quickly, but if a bad pivot is chosen, then the algorithm may take a long time to run.

The median pivot selection is known to be the most effective pivot selection method in practice, as it provides a good guarantee on the running time of the algorithm. If we could find the median pivot in $O(1)$ time, then we would have the best possible guarantee on the running time of the algorithm. However, finding the median pivot in constant time is not possible in the general case, as it requires sorting the entire array, which takes at least $O(n\log n)$ time.
--------------------------
So in short, the arithmetic mean or the the median?
--------------------------
In short, if we could find the pivot element in QuickSort in O(1) time, then the median pivot selection would give the best guarantee on the running time of the algorithm.

Which of the following is correct? The principle of “Memoization” in dynamic programming means that

a) we store the dynamic-programming recurrence in a static array so that it may be applied at each level of recursion.

b) we save the solutions of smaller subproblems if we need them again.

c) the dynamic-programming algorithm can remember the current location in the recursion tree.

d) we will remember the recursions occurring in dynamic programming for future exams.
--------------------------
The correct answer is b) we save the solutions of smaller subproblems if we need them again.

The principle of "Memoization" in dynamic programming means that we save the solutions of smaller subproblems so that we can reuse them later when they are needed again. This is done in order to avoid redundant work and improve the efficiency of the dynamic programming algorithm.

Option a) is incorrect because it refers to tabulation, which is a different technique for solving dynamic programming problems.

Option c) is also incorrect because it does not accurately describe the principle of Memoization in dynamic programming.

Option d) is not related to the principle of Memoization in dynamic programming and is therefore incorrect.

Which of the following properties is not a desired property of a hash function $h(x)?$

a) $h(x)$ should be computable in $O(1)$ time.

b) The values of $h(x)$ should be within the size of the hash table.

c) For different $x$, $h(x)$ should also assume different values.

d) If $x_1$ to $x_n$ are the elements to be inserted into the hash table, then $h(x_1)$ to $h(x_n)$ should be evenly distributed over the natural numbers.
--------------------------
The property that is not a desired property of a hash function $h(x)$ is d) If $x_1$ to $x_n$ are the elements to be inserted into the hash table, then $h(x_1)$ to $h(x_n)$ should be evenly distributed over the natural numbers.

Option a) is a desired property of a hash function because we want the hash function to be computable in $O(1)$ time so that we can quickly determine where to store and retrieve elements in the hash table.

Option b) is also a desired property of a hash function because we want the hash function to produce values that can be stored within the hash table.

Option c) is also a desired property of a hash function because we want different keys to map to different slots in the hash table to minimize collisions and improve the performance of the hash table.

Option d) is not a desired property of a hash function. While we do want a hash function to distribute the elements evenly across the hash table, we do not necessarily need them to be distributed evenly over the natural numbers. In fact, it is often sufficient to have them evenly distributed over a smaller range of values, such as the range of indices in the hash table. The natural numbers are too large a range to distribute values evenly over.

Which of the following is correct? If $T(n) = 2T(n/3) + \sqrt{n}$ holds, then we also have

a) $T(n) = \Theta(\sqrt{n})$

b) $T(n) = \Theta(n^2)$

c) $T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_3(2)})$

d) $T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log(3))}$
--------------------------
The correct answer is c) $T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_3(2)})$.

The recurrence relation $T(n) = 2T(n/3) + \sqrt{n}$ belongs to the case of the Master Theorem where $a=2$, $b=3$, and $f(n) = \sqrt{n}$.

We can calculate $n^{\log_b(a)}$ as $n^{\log_3(2)}$.

Since $f(n) = \sqrt{n}$ is polynomially smaller than $n^{\log_3(2)}$, which is the growth rate of $T(n)$, we are in case 1 of the Master Theorem. Therefore, we have $T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_3(2)})$, which is option c).

Option a) is incorrect because $\sqrt{n}$ is not $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$; it is actually $o(n)$.

Option b) is incorrect because $T(n)$ is not $\Theta(n^2)$.

Option d) is incorrect because $\log(3)$ is not equal to $\log_3(2)$.
