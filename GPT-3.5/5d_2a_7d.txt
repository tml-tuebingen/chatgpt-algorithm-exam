Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed graph. Which of the following algorithmic problems can be solved with DFS? 

a) Finding a source node.

b) Finding a sink node.

c) Both problems.

d) Neither of the two problems.
--------------------------
c) Both problems can be solved with DFS.

DFS (depth-first search) is a graph traversal algorithm that can be used to explore all the vertices and edges of a graph. During the DFS, it is possible to determine whether a vertex is a source node (i.e., a node with no incoming edges) or a sink node (i.e., a node with no outgoing edges).

To find a source node, we can perform a DFS starting from any vertex, and mark all the vertices reachable from that vertex. The remaining unmarked vertices are sources. To find a sink node, we can reverse the direction of all edges in the graph and perform a DFS starting from any vertex. The remaining unmarked vertices are sinks.

Therefore, DFS can be used to solve both problems.

For graphs with $\Theta(|V|^2)$ many edges, the Dijkstra algorithm is best implemented using a

a) Array.

b) Heap.

--------------------------
b) Heap.

Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights. The algorithm maintains a set of vertices whose shortest distance from the source node is known. The algorithm repeatedly selects the vertex with the minimum distance from the source node and updates the distances of its neighbors.

When implemented using an array, the time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is $\Theta(|V|^2)$, because in the worst case, we need to perform a linear search to find the vertex with the minimum distance.

On the other hand, when implemented using a heap data structure, the time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is $\Theta(|E|\log |V|)$, where $|E|$ is the number of edges in the graph and $|V|$ is the number of vertices. This is because we can use a min-heap to efficiently extract the vertex with the minimum distance in $\log |V|$ time, and we can update the distances of its neighbors in constant time.

Therefore, for graphs with $\Theta(|V|^2)$ many edges, it is more efficient to implement Dijkstra's algorithm using a heap.

If we could find the pivot element in the QuickSort algorithm in $O(1)$ time, then we would get the best guarantee on the running time with

a) the arithmetic mean

b) the median
--------------------------
b) the median.

In the standard QuickSort algorithm, the pivot element is typically chosen as the last element in the subarray being sorted. This can lead to a worst-case time complexity of $\Theta(n^2)$ if the input array is already sorted or nearly sorted.

If we could find the pivot element in $O(1)$ time, we could improve the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort. One way to do this is to choose the median element as the pivot. If the median is chosen as the pivot, the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort is $\Theta(n \log n)$.

Therefore, if we could find the pivot element in $O(1)$ time, it would be best to choose the median element as the pivot.
