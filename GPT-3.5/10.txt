Let $G=(V,E)$ be a connected, undirected and weighted graph. A cut $(S, V \setminus S)$ is a partition of the nodes (that is, we divide the nodes into two groups, not necessarily of equal size). A cut edge is an edge $(u,v)$ with one node in $S$ and one node in $V \setminus S$, that is $u\in S$ and $v\in V \setminus S$. Prove or disprove the following statement:

Assume that G has a uniquely determined minimum spanning tree. Then, for each cut $(S, V \setminus S)$ of G, there exists a uniquely determined cut edge with minimum weight.

The statement is true.

Proof:

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a connected, undirected and weighted graph with a uniquely determined minimum spanning tree, $T=(V_T,E_T)$. Let $(S, V \setminus S)$ be any cut of $G$.

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there are two different cut edges, $(u_1,v_1)$ and $(u_2,v_2)$, with minimum weight in the cut $(S,V\setminus S)$.

Since $T$ is a minimum spanning tree of $G$, it must contain a path between $u_1$ and $v_1$. Let $P$ be the path in $T$ between $u_1$ and $v_1$. If $(u_1,v_1)$ is not in $T$, then $P$ contains another edge $(u_1',v_1')$ with $u_1'\in S$ and $v_1'\in V\setminus S$. Since $(u_1,v_1)$ is a cut edge with minimum weight, we have $w(u_1,v_1)\leq w(u_1',v_1')$, which contradicts the assumption that $(u_1',v_1')$ has minimum weight in the cut $(S,V\setminus S)$. Therefore, $(u_1,v_1)$ must be in $T$.

Similarly, since $T$ is a tree, it must contain a unique path between any two vertices in $T$. Therefore, the path $P$ is unique. Let $w_P$ be the sum of the weights of the edges in $P$.

Consider the graph $T\cup{(u_2,v_2)}$. This graph has a unique cycle, $C$. Since $(u_1,v_1)$ is a cut edge with minimum weight, we have $w(u_1,v_1)\leq w(u_2,v_2)$. Therefore, we can replace the edge $(u_2,v_2)$ in $C$ with $(u_1,v_1)$ to obtain a new tree, $T'$. Note that $T'$ is still a spanning tree of $G$ since it still contains all vertices. Moreover, $T'$ has the same weight as $T$ since $w(T')=w(T)-(w(u_2,v_2)-w(u_1,v_1))$. However, $T'$ is different from $T$, which contradicts the assumption that $T$ is uniquely determined.

Therefore, our initial assumption that there are two different cut edges, $(u_1,v_1)$ and $(u_2,v_2)$, with minimum weight in the cut $(S,V\setminus S)$ must be false. Thus, for each cut $(S, V \setminus S)$ of $G$, there exists a uniquely determined cut edge with minimum weight.
