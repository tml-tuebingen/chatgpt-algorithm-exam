Give an instance of a knapsack problem with 4 different items and weights where the greedy algorithm does not find the optimal solution. The greedy algorithm selects in each step the item with the best value-weight ratio that still fits in the knapsack.
--------------------------
Sure! Here's an instance of the knapsack problem where the greedy algorithm does not find the optimal solution:

Consider a knapsack with a capacity of 7 and four items with the following weights and values:

Item	Weight	Value
1	3	8
2	2	7
3	4	9
4	5	10

If we apply the greedy algorithm, it will first select item 4, which has the best value-weight ratio of 2. Then, it will select item 2, which has a value-weight ratio of 3.5, and item 1, which has a value-weight ratio of 2.67. At this point, the knapsack is full, so the algorithm stops. This gives us a total value of 25.

However, the optimal solution is to select items 2 and 3, which have a total weight of 6 and a total value of 16. This is better than the solution obtained by the greedy algorithm.
