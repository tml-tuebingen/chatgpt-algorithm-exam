--------------------------
Perform the DFS algorithm on the following graph, starting at node $A$. Assume that the DFS algorithm visits nodes with smaller letters first when there is a choice. Give the order in which the various nodes are visited.

\begin{tikzpicture}[>=triangle 45,thick,node distance=25mm,scale=0.9,transform shape]
    \tikzstyle{every node}=[draw,shape=circle,minimum height=5mm,font=\small]
    
    \node (A) {A};
    \node (B) [above right of=A] {B};
    \node (D) [right of=B] {D};
    \node (F) [below of=B] {F};
    \node (E) [below of=D] {E};
    \node (C) [right of=E] {C};
    \node (G) [below left of=F] {G};
    \node (H) [below right of=F] {H};
    
    \path[every node/.style={auto,outer sep=-2pt,font=\small}]
      (A) edge node{} (B)
      (B) edge node{} (F)
      (B) edge node{} (D)
      (F) edge node{} (E)
      (D) edge node{} (F)
      (D) edge node{} (E)
      (E) edge node{} (C)
      (F) edge node{} (G)
      (F) edge node{} (H)
          ;
\end{tikzpicture} 


--------------------------
Starting at node A, the DFS algorithm visits the nodes in the following order:

A, B, D, F, E, C, G, H

The traversal follows the edge from A to B, then to F and then to E. From E, it backtracks to F and visits its other child G, then H. It backtracks to B, then to D, and from D to F, which was already visited, so it moves on to E and then to C. Finally, it backtracks to A, which is the root of the tree, and the traversal is complete.
--------------------------
Now give the discovery time and the finishing time of the different nodes. Start with the discovery time $t=1$ for node $A$.

You can insert the times in the following table.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Knoten $v$ & Discovery-Zeit($v$) & Finishing-Zeit($v$)\\ \hline \hline
A & 1 & \\ \hline
B & & \\ \hline
C & & \\ \hline
D & & \\ \hline
E & & \\ \hline
F & & \\ \hline
G & & \\ \hline
H & & \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\vspace{0.25cm}
\end{center}
--------------------------
Starting at node A, the DFS algorithm visits the nodes in the following order with the corresponding discovery and finishing times:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Node $v$ & Discovery Time ($v$) & Finishing Time ($v$) \ \hline \hline
A & 1 & 16 \ \hline
B & 2 & 9 \ \hline
C & 14 & 15 \ \hline
D & 3 & 8 \ \hline
E & 10 & 13 \ \hline
F & 4 & 7 \ \hline
G & 11 & 12 \ \hline
H & 5 & 6 \ \hline
\end{tabular}
\vspace{0.25cm}
\end{center}

The discovery time for node A is 1, which is the starting time of the traversal. The finishing time of node A is 16, which is the time when the traversal of the entire graph is completed. The discovery time for each subsequent node is the time when it is first visited by the DFS algorithm. The finishing time is the time when the DFS algorithm has finished processing all the children of the node and is ready to backtrack to its parent.
