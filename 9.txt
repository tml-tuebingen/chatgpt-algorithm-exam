Given an MxN matrix A of positive numbers, we can imagine this matrix as a game board of size MxN. The entry at $(i,j)$ corresponds to the costs that must be paid to enter field $(i,j)$  of the game board. We now want to move a game piece as cost-effectively as possible from the upper left field $(1,1)$ to the lower right field $(N,M)$. In each step, the game piece may only move one field down or one field to the right. So it can go from field $(i,j)$ to field $(i+1,j)$ or to field $(i,j+1)$. We are interested in the costs of the cheapest path from $(1,1)$ to $(N,M)$. In the following example, the cheapest path costs 33.

\newcommand\tikznode[2]{\tikz[remember picture,baseline=(#1.base)]{\node(#1)[inner sep=0pt]{#2};}}
\begin{equation*}
   A = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 7 & 8 & 4 & 6 \\
  6 & 7 & 3 & 9 & 2 \\
  3 & 8 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\
  7 & 1 & 7 & 3 & 7 \\
  2 & 9 & 8 & 9 & 3 \\
 \end{pmatrix},\qquad\text{A cheapest path } A= \begin{pmatrix}
  \tikznode{1}{1} & 7 & 8 & 4 & 6 \\
  \tikznode{2}{6} & \tikznode{3}{7} & \tikznode{4}{3} & 9 & 2 \\
  3 & 8 & \tikznode{5}{1} & \tikznode{6}{2} & 4 \\
  7 & 1 & 7 & \tikznode{7}{3} & \tikznode{8}{7} \\
  2 & 9 & 8 & 9 & \tikznode{9}{3} \\
 \end{pmatrix} 
\end{equation*}
\tikz[overlay,remember picture]{\draw[-](1)--(2);\draw[-](2)--(3);\draw[-](3)--(4);\draw[-](4)--(5);\draw[-](5)--(6);\draw[-](6)--(7);\draw[-](7)--(8);\draw[-](8)--(9);}

 This problem can be solved with dynamic programming. Set up an appropriate recursive equation.

 Hint: There is a typo in this exercise, you can assume M=N.

--------------------------
The recursive equation for solving this problem using dynamic programming is as follows:

Let $C(i,j)$ be the minimum cost to reach cell $(i,j)$. The base cases are $C(1,1) = A(1,1)$, $C(i,1) = \sum_{k=1}^{i} A(k,1)$, and $C(1,j) = \sum_{k=1}^{j} A(1,k)$ for all $1 \leq i,j \leq N$.

For $i,j > 1$, the recursive formula is given by:

$$C(i,j) = A(i,j) + \min(C(i-1,j),C(i,j-1))$$

The solution to the problem is $C(N,M)$. This recursive formula computes the minimum cost to reach each cell $(i,j)$ in the matrix by considering the minimum cost to reach the cells immediately above and to the left of $(i,j)$. By computing this recursively and storing the results in a table, we avoid redundant computations and obtain the solution to the problem in $O(N^2)$ time complexity.
--------------------------
Now complete the following pseudo-code to solve the problem in runtime $O(MN)$.

\Function{MatrixTravel}{Cost matrix $A$}
\State $T=$ MxN matrix filled with zeros
\For{$i = 1$ \textbf{to} $M$}
\For{$j = 1$ \textbf{to} $N$}
\vspace{8cm}
\EndFor
\EndFor
\State \Return{T[M,N]}
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

--------------------------
Sure, here's the completed pseudo-code to solve the problem in $O(MN)$ runtime:

\Function{MatrixTravel}{Cost matrix $A$}
\State $T=$ MxN matrix filled with zeros
\For{$i = 1$ \textbf{to} $M$}
\For{$j = 1$ \textbf{to} $N$}
\If{$i = 1$ and $j = 1$}
\State $T(1,1) = A(1,1)$
\ElsIf{$i = 1$}
\State $T(1,j) = A(1,j) + T(1,j-1)$
\ElsIf{$j = 1$}
\State $T(i,1) = A(i,1) + T(i-1,1)$
\Else
\State $T(i,j) = A(i,j) + \min(T(i-1,j),T(i,j-1))$
\EndIf
\EndFor
\EndFor
\State \Return{T(M,N)}
\EndFunction

This solution uses dynamic programming to compute the minimum cost of reaching each cell $(i,j)$ in the matrix. It initializes a matrix $T$ of the same size as $A$ filled with zeros. Then, it iterates through each cell of $T$, filling in the minimum cost to reach that cell using the recursive formula in the previous answer.

The base cases are handled by initializing $T(1,1) = A(1,1)$ and filling in the first row and column of $T$ using the cumulative sum of the corresponding rows and columns of $A$. Finally, the solution is given by $T(M,N)$.

This algorithm runs in $O(MN)$ time complexity since it iterates through each cell of the $M$x$N$ matrix $T$ only once, and the time required to fill in each cell is constant.
