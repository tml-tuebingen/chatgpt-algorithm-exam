Hello! I'm ready to help you with your computer science exam questions. Please go ahead and provide the questions, and I'll do my best to give short and precise answers.
--------------------------
To all questions from now on, there is exactly one correct answer.
--------------------------
Understood. Please provide the questions, and I will do my best to give the correct answer for each one.
--------------------------
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed graph. Which of the following algorithmic problems can be solved with DFS? 

a) Finding a source node.

b) Finding a sink node.

c) Both problems.

d) Neither of the two problems.
--------------------------
c) Both problems.

DFS (Depth-First Search) can be used to find both a source node (a node with no incoming edges) and a sink node (a node with no outgoing edges) in a directed graph.
--------------------------
For graphs with $\Theta(|V|^2)$ many edges, the Dijkstra algorithm is best implemented using a

a) Array.

b) Heap.
--------------------------
b) Heap.

When there are Î˜(|V|^2) edges, implementing Dijkstra's algorithm with a heap (such as a binary or Fibonacci heap) is more efficient, as it reduces the overall time complexity of the algorithm.
--------------------------
If we could find the pivot element in the QuickSort algorithm in $O(1)$ time, then we would get the best guarantee on the running time with

a) the arithmetic mean

b) the median
--------------------------
b) the median

If we could find the median element as the pivot in O(1) time, QuickSort would have the best-case guaranteed running time. The median ensures the partition is balanced, leading to an O(n log n) time complexity.
