Hello! I'm ready to help you with your computer science exam questions about algorithms. Please provide the questions and I'll do my best to give you short, precise answers.

Prove that $\sqrt{n}\in o(n^{2/3})$ holds. Please be short and precise.
--------------------------
To prove that $\sqrt{n} \in o(n^{2/3})$, we need to show that $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\sqrt{n}}{n^{2/3}} = 0$.

Using the properties of exponents, we can rewrite the expression inside the limit as:

$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n^{1/2}}{n^{2/3}} = \lim_{n\to\infty} n^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{2}{3}}$

Now, subtract the exponents:

$\frac{1}{2} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{3 - 4}{6} = -\frac{1}{6}$

So the expression becomes:

$\lim_{n\to\infty} n^{-1/6}$

As $n$ approaches infinity, $n^{-1/6}$ approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, and we have shown that $\sqrt{n} \in o(n^{2/3})$.
