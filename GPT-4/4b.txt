Hello! I'm ready to help you with your computer science exam questions about algorithms. Please go ahead and provide the questions, and I will do my best to give you short, precise answers.
--------------------------
Consider the following algorithm. The algorithm receives as input a connected, undirected, weighted graph $G=(V,E,c)$ with edge weight function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$.

    \begin{algorithmic}
    \Function{AlternativeMST}{}
    \State $E_T = \emptyset$\;
    \State Sei $s$ beliebiger Knoten in $G$\;
    \For{$v \in V \setminus\{s\}$}
    	\State Let $e=(v,w)$ be the edge of $v$ with minimal weight $c(e)$ that does not belong to $E_T$\;
    	\State $E_T \leftarrow E_T \cup \{e\}$\;
    \EndFor
    \State \Return{$(V,E_T)$}
    \EndFunction
    \end{algorithmic}

Is AlternativeMST correct, that is, does AlternativeMST actually calculate a Minimum Spanning Tree of $G$? Prove or disprove that AlternativeMST calculates a MST.
--------------------------
The given AlternativeMST algorithm does not always calculate a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of G. Let's disprove it using a counterexample.

Consider a connected, undirected, weighted graph G with vertices V = {A, B, C, D} and edges E = {(A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (B, C), (B, D), (C, D)} with weights given by the edge weight function c:

c(A, B) = 1
c(A, C) = 2
c(A, D) = 3
c(B, C) = 4
c(B, D) = 5
c(C, D) = 6

Now, let's apply the AlternativeMST algorithm:

Set s = A (an arbitrary vertex).
For vertex B, the minimal weight edge is (A, B) with weight 1. Add this edge to E_T.
For vertex C, the minimal weight edge is (A, C) with weight 2. Add this edge to E_T.
For vertex D, the minimal weight edge is (A, D) with weight 3. Add this edge to E_T.

The resulting tree T = (V, E_T) has edges E_T = {(A, B), (A, C), (A, D)} and total weight 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

However, the actual MST of G is:

MST = {(A, B), (A, C), (B, D)} with total weight 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.

Since the resulting tree from the AlternativeMST algorithm does not match the actual MST, we can conclude that the AlternativeMST algorithm does not always calculate a Minimum Spanning Tree of G.
