Hello! I'm ready to help you with your computer science exam questions. Please go ahead and provide the questions, and I'll do my best to give you short and precise answers.
--------------------------
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a connected, undirected and weighted graph. A cut $(S, V \setminus S)$ is a partition of the nodes (that is, we divide the nodes into two groups, not necessarily of equal size). A cut edge is an edge $(u,v)$ with one node in $S$ and one node in $V \setminus S$, that is $u\in S$ and $v\in V \setminus S$. Prove or disprove the following statement:

Assume that G has a uniquely determined minimum spanning tree. Then, for each cut $(S, V \setminus S)$ of G, there exists a uniquely determined cut edge with minimum weight.
--------------------------
We will prove the statement:

Given that G has a uniquely determined minimum spanning tree (MST), for each cut (S, V \setminus S) of G, there exists a uniquely determined cut edge with minimum weight.

Proof:

Let T be the unique minimum spanning tree of G.

Consider an arbitrary cut (S, V \setminus S) of G. According to the Cut Property of MSTs, there must exist an edge (u, v) with the minimum weight among all the cut edges, such that u ∈ S and v ∈ V \setminus S, and this edge is included in the MST T.

Now, we need to show that this edge is unique for the given cut.

Assume, for contradiction, that there exists another edge (u', v') with the same minimum weight for the cut (S, V \setminus S), where u' ∈ S and v' ∈ V \setminus S, and (u', v') ≠ (u, v). Since T is an MST, it must already contain a path between u' and v' (otherwise, adding (u', v') to T would yield a smaller weight spanning tree, which contradicts the uniqueness of T).

If we add the edge (u', v') to T, we create a cycle that contains both (u, v) and (u', v'), as there is now a path between u and v and a path between u' and v' in T. Since (u, v) and (u', v') have the same weight, we can replace (u, v) with (u', v') in T, and the total weight of T remains the same, meaning that we have found another MST.

However, this contradicts our initial assumption that G has a uniquely determined minimum spanning tree. Thus, our assumption that there is another edge (u', v') with the same minimum weight for the cut (S, V \setminus S) must be false. Therefore, for each cut (S, V \setminus S) of G, there exists a uniquely determined cut edge with minimum weight.
