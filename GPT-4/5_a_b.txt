Hello! I'm ready to help you with your computer science exam questions. Please go ahead and provide the questions, and I'll do my best to give short and precise answers.

Perform the DFS algorithm on the following graph, starting at node $A$. Assume that the DFS algorithm visits nodes with smaller letters first when there is a choice. Give the order in which the various nodes are visited.

\begin{tikzpicture}[>=triangle 45,thick,node distance=25mm,scale=0.9,transform shape]
    \tikzstyle{every node}=[draw,shape=circle,minimum height=5mm,font=\small]
    
    \node (A) {A};
    \node (B) [above right of=A] {B};
    \node (D) [right of=B] {D};
    \node (F) [below of=B] {F};
    \node (E) [below of=D] {E};
    \node (C) [right of=E] {C};
    \node (G) [below left of=F] {G};
    \node (H) [below right of=F] {H};
    
    \path[every node/.style={auto,outer sep=-2pt,font=\small}]
      (A) edge node{} (B)
      (B) edge node{} (F)
      (B) edge node{} (D)
      (F) edge node{} (E)
      (D) edge node{} (F)
      (D) edge node{} (E)
      (E) edge node{} (C)
      (F) edge node{} (G)
      (F) edge node{} (H)
          ;
\end{tikzpicture} 

--------------------------
To perform the DFS algorithm on the given graph starting at node A and visiting nodes with smaller letters first when there is a choice, we will follow this order:

A
B
D
E
C
F
G
H

So the order in which the nodes are visited is A-B-D-E-C-F-G-H.
--------------------------
Now give the discovery time and the finishing time of the different nodes. Start with the discovery time $t=1$ for node $A$.

You can insert the times in the following table.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Knoten $v$ & Discovery-Zeit($v$) & Finishing-Zeit($v$)\\ \hline \hline
A & 1 & \\ \hline
B & & \\ \hline
C & & \\ \hline
D & & \\ \hline
E & & \\ \hline
F & & \\ \hline
G & & \\ \hline
H & & \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\vspace{0.25cm}
\end{center}
--------------------------
Here is the table with the discovery and finishing times for each node:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Node $v$ & Discovery Time($v$) & Finishing Time($v$)\ \hline \hline
A & 1 & 16\ \hline
B & 2 & 15\ \hline
C & 6 & 7\ \hline
D & 3 & 14\ \hline
E & 4 & 13\ \hline
F & 8 & 12\ \hline
G & 9 & 10\ \hline
H & 11 & 12\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\vspace{0.25cm}
\end{center}

To clarify, the discovery time is when a node is first visited, and the finishing time is when all of its descendants have been explored and the node's exploration is completed.
