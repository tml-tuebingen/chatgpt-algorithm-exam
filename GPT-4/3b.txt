Give an instance of a knapsack problem with 4 different items and weights where the greedy algorithm does not find the optimal solution. The greedy algorithm selects in each step the item with the best value-weight ratio that still fits in the knapsack.
--------------------------
Consider a knapsack with a capacity of 50 units and the following 4 items:

Item A: weight = 40 units, value = 60
Item B: weight = 25 units, value = 45
Item C: weight = 25 units, value = 45
Item D: weight = 10 units, value = 20

Using the greedy algorithm, we first compute the value-weight ratios:

Item A: 60/40 = 1.5
Item B: 45/25 = 1.8
Item C: 45/25 = 1.8
Item D: 20/10 = 2.0

The greedy algorithm selects items in the order D, B (or C), as they have the highest value-weight ratios. The total value is 20 + 45 = 65.

However, the optimal solution is to select items A and C (or A and B), which results in a total value of 60 + 45 = 105. In this instance, the greedy algorithm does not find the optimal solution.
