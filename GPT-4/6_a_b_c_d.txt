Consider the following directed Graph.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=triangle 45,thick,node distance=25mm,scale=0.9,transform shape]
    \tikzstyle{every node}=[draw,shape=circle,minimum height=5mm,font=\small]
    
    \node (A) {A};
    \node (B) [above right of=A] {B};
    \node (C) [below right of=A] {C};
    \node (D) [right of=B] {D};
    \node (E) [right of=C] {E};
    \node (F) [right of=D] {F};
    \node (G) [right of=E] {G};
    \node (H) [right of=F] {H};
    \node (I) [right of=G] {I};
    \node (K) [right of=H] {K};
    \node (J) [right of=I] {J};
    
    \path[every node/.style={auto,outer sep=-2pt,font=\small}]
      (A) edge node{} (B)
      (A) edge node{} (C)
      (C) edge node{} (E)
      (C) edge node{} (B)
      (D) edge node{} (E)
      (E) edge node{} (C)
      (F) edge node{} (D)
      (E) edge node{} (G)
      (G) edge node{} (I)
      (I) edge node{} (H)
      (H) edge node{} (G)
      (G) edge node{} (F)
      (K) edge node{} (J)
      (H) edge node{} (J)
      (D) edge node{} (C);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

How many strongly connected components does this graph have?
--------------------------
In the given directed graph, the strongly connected components can be identified by looking for sets of vertices where every vertex in the set is reachable from every other vertex in the set.

The strongly connected components are as follows:

{A}
{B}
{C, E}
{D}
{F}
{G, H, I}
{J}
{K}

There are 8 strongly connected components in the graph.
--------------------------
Draw the corresponding component graph.
--------------------------
To draw the component graph, first, we collapse each strongly connected component into a single node, then remove any self-loops and duplicate edges. Here's the component graph:

rust
Copy code
1. A -> B
2. B -> CE
3. CE -> CE (self-loop will be removed)
4. D -> CE
5. F -> D
6. F -> GHI
7. GHI -> GHI (self-loop will be removed)
8. H -> J
9. K -> J


Now, we can represent this as a simple directed graph:

css
Copy code
A --→ B --→ CE ←-- D ←-- F --→ GHI
          ↑                   ↓
          J ←-- H ←----------- GHI
          ↑
          K


In this component graph, we have represented the strongly connected components as nodes (A, B, CE, D, F, GHI, J, K), and the directed edges indicate the connections between these components.
--------------------------
Number the different nodes of the component graph according to the alphabet, i.e., $A$, $B$, $C$, etc. Then specify a topological sort of the component graph.
--------------------------
First, let's assign alphabetical labels to the nodes of the component graph. Since we have 8 components, we will use the first 8 letters of the alphabet:

A - A
B - B
C - CE
D - D
E - F
F - GHI
G - J
H - K

Now, let's perform a topological sort on the component graph:

A
B
D
C
E
F
H
G

This topological sort represents a valid linear ordering of the component graph nodes, respecting the directed edges between them.
--------------------------
Which nodes of the component graph are source nodes, which are sink nodes?
--------------------------
In the component graph, source nodes are those with no incoming edges, and sink nodes are those with no outgoing edges. Let's identify them based on the component graph:

css
Copy code
A --→ B --→ CE ←-- D ←-- F --→ GHI
          ↑                   ↓
          J ←-- H ←----------- GHI
          ↑
          K


Source nodes: A, E, H

Sink nodes: G

In the component graph, nodes A, E (corresponding to F in the original graph), and H (corresponding to K in the original graph) are source nodes, while node G (corresponding to J in the original graph) is a sink node.
