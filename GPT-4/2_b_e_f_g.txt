Hello! I'm ready to help you with your computer science exam questions. Please provide the questions, and I'll do my best to give you short and precise answers.
--------------------------
To all questions from now on, please just answer with a single word: "True" or "False"
--------------------------
Understood.
--------------------------
The connected components of an undirected graph are uniquely determined
--------------------------
True
--------------------------
In the Relax-operation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, if we replace the minimum with the maximum, then the algorithm will not find the shortest, but the longest paths between pairs of vertices.
--------------------------
False
--------------------------
If you increase every edge weight by the same positive constant, then the solution to the single-source shortest-path problem will not change.
--------------------------
False
--------------------------
A connected, unweighted Graph $G=(V,E)$ has a unique minimum spanning tree.
--------------------------
False
