Given an MxN matrix A of positive numbers, we can imagine this matrix as a game board of size MxN. The entry at $(i,j)$ corresponds to the costs that must be paid to enter field $(i,j)$  of the game board. We now want to move a game piece as cost-effectively as possible from the upper left field $(1,1)$ to the lower right field $(N,M)$. In each step, the game piece may only move one field down or one field to the right. So it can go from field $(i,j)$ to field $(i+1,j)$ or to field $(i,j+1)$. We are interested in the costs of the cheapest path from $(1,1)$ to $(N,M)$. In the following example, the cheapest path costs 33.

\newcommand\tikznode[2]{\tikz[remember picture,baseline=(#1.base)]{\node(#1)[inner sep=0pt]{#2};}}
\begin{equation*}
   A = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 7 & 8 & 4 & 6 \\
  6 & 7 & 3 & 9 & 2 \\
  3 & 8 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\
  7 & 1 & 7 & 3 & 7 \\
  2 & 9 & 8 & 9 & 3 \\
 \end{pmatrix},\qquad\text{A cheapest path } A= \begin{pmatrix}
  \tikznode{1}{1} & 7 & 8 & 4 & 6 \\
  \tikznode{2}{6} & \tikznode{3}{7} & \tikznode{4}{3} & 9 & 2 \\
  3 & 8 & \tikznode{5}{1} & \tikznode{6}{2} & 4 \\
  7 & 1 & 7 & \tikznode{7}{3} & \tikznode{8}{7} \\
  2 & 9 & 8 & 9 & \tikznode{9}{3} \\
 \end{pmatrix} 
\end{equation*}
\tikz[overlay,remember picture]{\draw[-](1)--(2);\draw[-](2)--(3);\draw[-](3)--(4);\draw[-](4)--(5);\draw[-](5)--(6);\draw[-](6)--(7);\draw[-](7)--(8);\draw[-](8)--(9);}

 This problem can be solved with dynamic programming. Set up an appropriate recursive equation.

 Hint: There is a typo in this exercise, you can assume M=N.
--------------------------
Given the hint that M = N, we can represent the matrix as an NxN matrix. To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can set up a recursive equation for the minimum cost to reach any cell (i, j) in the matrix.

Let's define a function minCost(i, j) that represents the minimum cost to reach cell (i, j) from cell (1, 1). Then, the recursive equation can be written as:

minCost(i, j) = A[i][j] + min(minCost(i-1, j), minCost(i, j-1))

Here, A[i][j] represents the cost of entering cell (i, j). The base cases for this recursive equation are:

minCost(1, 1) = A[1][1]
minCost(i, 1) = A[i][1] + minCost(i-1, 1) for all i > 1
minCost(1, j) = A[1][j] + minCost(1, j-1) for all j > 1

The minimum cost to reach the lower right cell (N, N) will be the value of minCost(N, N).
--------------------------
Now complete the following pseudo-code to solve the problem in runtime $O(MN)$.

\Function{MatrixTravel}{Cost matrix $A$}
\State $T=$ MxN matrix filled with zeros
\For{$i = 1$ \textbf{to} $M$}
\For{$j = 1$ \textbf{to} $N$}
\vspace{8cm}
\EndFor
\EndFor
\State \Return{T[M,N]}
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
--------------------------
Here's the completed pseudocode for the MatrixTravel function, which calculates the minimum cost to reach the lower right cell (M, N) using dynamic programming:

\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{MatrixTravel}{Cost matrix $A$}
\State $T=$ MxN matrix filled with zeros
\State $T[1,1] = A[1,1]$
\For{$i = 2$ \textbf{to} $M$}
\State $T[i,1] = A[i,1] + T[i-1,1]$
\EndFor
\For{$j = 2$ \textbf{to} $N$}
\State $T[1,j] = A[1,j] + T[1,j-1]$
\EndFor
\For{$i = 2$ \textbf{to} $M$}
\For{$j = 2$ \textbf{to} $N$}
\State $T[i,j] = A[i,j] + \min(T[i-1,j], T[i,j-1])$
\EndFor
\EndFor
\State \Return{T[M,N]}
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

This algorithm has a runtime complexity of $O(MN)$ because it iterates through each cell of the MxN matrix exactly once.
