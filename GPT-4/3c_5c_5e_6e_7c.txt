\begin{tikzpicture}[level/.style={sibling distance=30mm/#1}]
\node [circle,draw] (a){7}

        child {node [circle,draw] (d) {8}}
    }

False
--------------------------
\item An undirected and unweighted graph is given as an adjacency matrix. Then the running time of the DFS algorithm is $O(|V|+|E|)$.
--------------------------
False
--------------------------
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed, unweighted graph. A topological sorting exists only if the graph is acyclic.
--------------------------
True
--------------------------
In a directed, acyclic graph, the component graph corresponds to the original graph.
--------------------------
False
--------------------------
 If a graph does not contain a negative weight cycle, then the result of the Dijkstra algorithm is correct.
--------------------------
True
