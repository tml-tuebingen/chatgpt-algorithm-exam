Consider hashing with linear probing and the hash function $h(x) = (7 \cdot x + 2) \mod 11.$ The corresponding hash table consists of an array of length 11. Insert the elements $2$, $3$, $7$, $15$ and $1$ in this order into the hash table.
--------------------------
To insert the elements 2, 3, 7, 15, and 1 into the hash table using the hash function h(x) = (7 * x + 2) mod 11 and linear probing, we follow these steps:

Compute the hash for each element.
Insert the element into the hash table at the corresponding index. If there's a collision, use linear probing to find the next available slot.

Here's the process for each element:

Element 2:
h(2) = (7 * 2 + 2) mod 11 = 16 mod 11 = 5
Insert 2 at index 5.

Element 3:
h(3) = (7 * 3 + 2) mod 11 = 23 mod 11 = 1
Insert 3 at index 1.

Element 7:
h(7) = (7 * 7 + 2) mod 11 = 51 mod 11 = 6
Insert 7 at index 6.

Element 15:
h(15) = (7 * 15 + 2) mod 11 = 107 mod 11 = 9
Insert 15 at index 9.

Element 1:
h(1) = (7 * 1 + 2) mod 11 = 9 mod 11 = 9
Collision at index 9. Using linear probing, we look for the next available slot.
Index 10 is empty.
Insert 1 at index 10.

The final hash table looks like this:
Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Value: [ , 3, , , , 2, 7, , ,15, 1]
