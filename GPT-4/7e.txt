Hello! I'm ready to help you with your computer science exam questions about algorithms. Please go ahead and provide the questions, and I'll do my best to provide short and precise answers.

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed graph. Now assume we define a weight function on the nodes, i.e., $c:V\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. Does it still make sense to speak of the shortest path problem with a weight function on the nodes? If Yes, then give a formal definition of the problem. If No, then explain why the problem makes no sense.

Yes, it still makes sense to speak of the shortest path problem with a weight function on the nodes. To transform the problem into a more conventional shortest path problem with edge weights, you can associate the weight of a node with its outgoing edges.

Given a directed graph G=(V,E) with a weight function on the nodes c: V -> R≥0, the objective is to find the shortest path between two nodes, s (source) and t (target), such that the total weight of the path is minimized.

Formally, the problem can be defined as:

Input: A directed graph G=(V,E), a weight function on the nodes c: V -> R≥0, a source node s ∈ V, and a target node t ∈ V.

Output: A path P from s to t in G such that the total weight of the nodes in P is minimized.

To solve this problem, you can modify the graph by assigning the weight of each node v to its outgoing edges (v, u) for all u ∈ V. Let the modified edge weight function be c': E -> R≥0, defined as c'(v, u) = c(v) for all (v, u) ∈ E. Now, you can apply any shortest path algorithm, such as Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford, to find the shortest path with respect to the modified edge weights c'.
