Perform the Dijkstra algorithm on the following graph to find the shortest path from A to all other nodes. Give the order in which the Dijkstra algorithm visits the nodes.

\begin{tikzpicture}[>=triangle 45,thick,node distance=20mm,scale=0.9,transform shape]
    \tikzstyle{every node}=[draw,shape=circle,minimum height=5mm,font=\small]
    
    \node (A) {A};
    \node (B) [above right of=A] {B};
    \node (C) [below right of=A] {C};
    \node (D) [right of=B] {D};
    \node (E) [right of=C] {E};
    \node (F) [below right of=D] {F};
    \node (G) [above right of=B] {G};
    
    \path[every node/.style={auto,outer sep=-2pt,font=\small}]
        (A) edge node{3}  (B)
        (A) edge node{4}  (C)
        (B) edge node{2}  (G)
        (B) edge node{3}  (C)
        (G) edge node{3}  (D)
        (B) edge node{7}  (D)
        (D) edge node{2}  (E)
        (B) edge node{5}  (E)
        (C) edge node{3}  (E)
        (D) edge node{1}  (F)
        (E) edge node{2}  (F)
          ;

To find the shortest path from node A to all other nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm, we will follow these steps:

Assign a tentative distance value to all nodes: set it to zero for the initial node (A) and infinity for other nodes.
Set the initial node (A) as the current node.
For the current node, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the new value if it is less than the current value.
Mark the current node as visited.
Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current node, then go back to step 3. If all nodes have been visited, the algorithm has finished.

Here's the step-by-step process for the given graph:

Initial state:
A: 0 (current)
B: ∞
C: ∞
D: ∞
E: ∞
F: ∞
G: ∞

Visit A (0):
A -> B: 0 + 3 = 3
A -> C: 0 + 4 = 4
B: 3
C: 4
D: ∞
E: ∞
F: ∞
G: ∞

Visit B (3):
B -> G: 3 + 2 = 5
B -> C: 3 + 3 = 6
B -> D: 3 + 7 = 10
B -> E: 3 + 5 = 8
C: 4
D: 10
E: 8
F: ∞
G: 5

Visit C (4):
C -> E: 4 + 3 = 7
D: 10
E: 7
F: ∞
G: 5

Visit G (5):
G -> D: 5 + 3 = 8
D: 8
E: 7
F: ∞

Visit E (7):
E -> F: 7 + 2 = 9
D: 8
F: 9

Visit D (8):
D -> E: 8 + 2 = 10 (not an improvement)
D -> F: 8 + 1 = 9 (not an improvement)
F: 9

Visit F (9):
All nodes visited.

The order in which Dijkstra's algorithm visits the nodes is: A, B, C, G, E, D, F.
--------------------------
What is the order in the Dijkstra algorithm visits the nodes?
--------------------------
Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. Here is the correct order in which Dijkstra's algorithm visits the nodes:

A, B, C, G, E, D, F
--------------------------
Now give the length of the shortest path from A to all other nodes.
--------------------------
Here are the lengths of the shortest paths from node A to all other nodes, as determined by Dijkstra's algorithm:

A to B: 3
A to C: 4
A to G: 5
A to E: 7
A to D: 8
A to F: 9
