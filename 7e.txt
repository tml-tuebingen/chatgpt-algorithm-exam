Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed graph. Now assume we define a weight function on the nodes, i.e., $c:V\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. Does it still make sense to speak of the shortest path problem with a weight function on the nodes? If Yes, then give a formal definition of the problem. If No, then explain why the problem makes no sense.
--------------------------
It is not meaningful to speak of the shortest path problem with a weight function on the nodes, as the weight function is typically defined on the edges in the problem. The shortest path problem seeks to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, where the distance between nodes is defined by the sum of the weights of the edges on the path between them.

However, if we define a weight function on the nodes, we can modify the shortest path problem to account for this by incorporating the node weights into the edge weights. Specifically, we can define the weight of an edge $(u,v)$ to be the sum of the weight of the starting node $u$ and the weight of the ending node $v$, i.e., $w(u,v) = c(u) + c(v)$. Then, we can solve the modified shortest path problem using any standard shortest path algorithm, such as Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm.
